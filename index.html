                    I want to be remembered as a person who solves problems with creativty and as a person that teaches others to solve problems with creativty.

                <p>    
                    To achieve this goal, I will keep trying to improve myself by learning from others and working on projects. I want to join the DevSoc Training program to learn about frameworks and develop web application that is impactful.

                    Solving problems gets us to greater heights, it is the most direct way to improve ourselves which is why I like coding and mathematics. I was introduced to coding with HTML and CSS. Then I moved to Python where I learned about loops, variables and all basic control structures. I recently started looking at React, a JavaScript Framework used for front-end development.
