Portfolio Website. 

The theme was "Circles". I implemented by adding images that are circular in shape. I also implmented a lot of organic shapes. Also I added the Dark Mode to Light Mode Switch, inspired by the DevSoc's "Circles" Application. There are links at the bottom of the page. I have implemented JavaScript as well, it lets you scroll through images. Just click on the arrows present next to the images on the Projects Page and the Hobbies Page.
