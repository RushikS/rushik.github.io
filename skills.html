                        HTML was how I was introduced to coding. I understood that it was the backbone behind all websites. It was a very intuitive language without much difficult in terms of Syntax. I understand that we are moving more towards dynamic websites which means there is an increased reliance on backend frameworks which I want to learn from the Training Program.

                        CSS has changed over the years as the usage of mobiles increases. This is because making websites that are display content clearly on both laptops, phones and tablets becomes a priority. This responsiveness is possible with flexbox. This is something I implemented in my Portfolio Website. By joining the DevSoc Training Program, I want to learn Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap frameworks to expand my skills in front-end web development.
